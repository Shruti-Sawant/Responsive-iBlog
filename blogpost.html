            The famous Patagonia region of Argentina has some amazing hiking trails, but the very best would have to be
            the day hike to
            Mount Fitz Roy and the Laguna De Los Tres!
            <br> <br>

            This entire trek is full of great scenery, and at the end you
            get to see a spectacular blue glacier lake called Laguna De Los Tres, which sits at the foot of Mount Fitz
            Roy, one of the most impressive and iconic peaks in South America.

            The Fitz Roy hike is a challenge, with plenty of distance and
            elevation gain, but most hikers will still find it very doable. And even if you don’t go all the way to the
            lakes, you can still get amazing pictures of the mountains from the Fitz Roy Mirador (viewpoint) after only
            a moderate amount of hiking from the town of El Chalten.
            <br><br>
            This travel guide will explain how to do the Laguna De Los Tres
            hike, what to bring, best time to visit, how to get to El Chalten, and everything
            else you need to know before you go!

            There’s no airport in El Chalten, so the closest airport for this hike is the small international one in El
            Calafate (FTE), which has direct flights from Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Ushuaia, and other places.
            <br><br>
            The flight from Buenos Aires to El Calafate takes about 3 hours and it’s offered by multiple airlines, with
            pretty reasonable prices. There are two airports in Buenos Aires (AEP or EZE) and you can use either of them
            to fly here. You can shop for flights to Argentina on Skyscanner.

            Once you arrive in El Calafate, it’s a 3 hour drive to El Chalten. You can get there with a bus,
            private shuttle, or rental car.
            <br><br> The bus service is offered by multiple companies with regular departures.

            If you’re short on time, there are also day tours from El Calafate to Laguna De Los Tres
            (more on that below).

        </p>

        <h2>Best Fitz Roy Patagonia Tours</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re on a tight schedule and want to visit Patagonia without much advance planning, GetYourGuide has
            day tours for El Chalten and El Calafate, including some of the best hikes like Laguna De Los Tres!
            <br>
            They have high-rated Fitz Roy day tours that include hotel pickup and drop-off, plus transportation from El
            Calafate to El Chalten, and optional lunch. A tour like this is not required for the hike, but it can still

        <h2>Laguna De Los Tres Hike: What To Expect</h2>
        <p>
            The hike to Laguna De Los Tres is an out and back trail that is mostly flat except for a few kilometers of
            uphill trekking at the start, and then again at the end of the trail.
            <br>
            This is a very popular hike, and it’s usually done as a day hike, but there are also campgrounds along the
            trail if you want to stay longer and combine it into a loop hike with the nearby Laguna Torre.
            <br>
            The sections below will explain each part of the Fitz Roy hike and what to expect!
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>
            Starting The Hike From El Chalten
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you first start the Fitz Roy hike, it’s uphill right away. In fact, the first few kilometers have a big
            chunk of the total elevation gain of the whole trail.
            <br>
            Along the way, you’ll pass some downed trees that make a nice place to sit and rest a minute,
            and there are kilometer markers to let you know how far you’ve gone on the trail.
        </p>
        <p>• Laguna Capri
            After hiking about 3.3 kilometers, there’s a fork in the path where you can choose to go to either a lake
            (Laguna Capri) or the Fitz Roy viewpoint.
            <br>
            I would recommend doing the viewpoint on your way up and the lake on your way down. There is also a
            campground at Laguna Capri if you plan to stay longer.
        </p>


        <h2>Mirador Del Fitz Roy Viewpoint</h2>
        <p>After hiking about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from El Chalten, you’ll arrive at the ‘Mirador Del Fitz Roy’
            viewpoint, which has some of the most spectacular views of the entire hike.
            <br>
            On a clear day, you have a front row seat to see Mount Fitz Roy and the jagged peaks of Patagonia. Even
            though the mountains are still far away, they feel so close here! There’s a handy sign at the viewpoint
            labeling all of the mountain peaks for you.
            <br>
            It really is one of the most stunning sights in the world. The only difference here is that you can’t see
            the lake of Laguna De Los Tres. That comes later.
            On a cloudy day, you may not see much at the viewpoint, but I’d encourage you to wait for the clouds to
            clear, or else come back later and try again.
            <br><br>
            Because of Patagonia’s always changing weather, I had to re-visit the spot a couple of times before I
            finally got to see the mountains revealed. All the effort was worth it!
            <br>
            This viewpoint is popular with day hikers, but there’s plenty of space to spread out and take photos. It’s a
            good spot to break into snacks and drinks, and there’s also a vault toilet in the forest near the clearing.
            <br>
            You can reach the Mirador Del Fitz Roy viewpoint in about 1.5 hours of hiking from El Chalten. All in all,
            it’s perfect if you want to see great scenery on a shorter and easier hike than going all the way to Laguna
            De Los Tres!
        <h2>Fitz Roy Secret Waterfall</h2>
        <p>After hiking about 5.3 kilometers from El Chalten, there’s a short spur trail where you can go see a secret
            waterfall. The location is marked with an icon on Google Maps and AllTrails.
            <br>
            This is a nice little waterfall with Mount Fitz Roy in the background, and you only have to walk about 150
            meters from the main trail to see it! There’s really no danger of getting lost.
            <br>
            Even at the end of summer, the waterfall is still active, and it’s bigger in person than it looks in
            pictures. It’s a great addition to your trek if you have a bit of extra time and want to take some more
            photos of Patagonia.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For most of the rest of the Fitz Roy trek, you’ll be walking through a flat valley trail with little to no
            elevation gain or obstacles.
            <br>
            This is the easiest section of the hike, and it’s one of the most enjoyable parts in my opinion, because the
            path is almost completely flat, so you can just enjoy the scenery of Patagonia without working up a sweat.
            <br>
            Along the way, you’ll get to see ponds, marshes, meadows, and streams running through the valley, with the
            ever present Mount Fitz Roy looming in front of you the whole time.
            The photo ops here are endless. If you do the hike in autumn, you can see lots of fall leaf colors, but
            especially red and orange.
            <br>
            You’ll also notice another glacier approaching in the distance. That’s Piedras Blancas, and there’s a spur
            trail to see it up close if you have time.
            <br>
            Going to the Piedras Blancas glacier viewpoint adds about 2 kilometers in each direction and it’s relatively
            flat as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Climbing To Laguna De Los Tres</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you’ve crossed the valley, it’s time for the hardest part of the Fitz Roy hike — the climb to
            Laguna De Los Tres!
            <br>
            This part involves trekking and scrambling up a steep slope with loose rocks and gravel for the last 2
            kilometers (1.2 miles). It’s a big workout, with more than 450 meters of elevation gain.
            <br>
            A sign by the hill warns ‘good physical condition required’ for this section, and I’d say that’s about
            right. Watch for wet and slippery rocks on the way up.
            The last reward of this hike is the spectacular blue lake of Laguna De Los Tres. It’s amazing! The name
            means ‘Lake of the Three’ in Spanish, and it comes from the three peaks surrounding the lake: Fitz Roy,
            Poincenot, and Saint-Exupery.
            <br><br>
            You can admire the lake from above, and then hike down the hill to see the lake up close. The melting
            glacier water gives it a really stunning turquoise color, and there’s even a perfect boulder at the foot of
            the lake that you can pose on for pictures.
            <br>
            There are actually two lakes here, but in order to see the second one (‘Laguna Sucia’) you have to climb the
            small hill near the lake. Don’t miss it! From there, you can enjoy panoramic views of both blue lakes, plus
            a waterfall, and Fitz Roy in between. This is where the hike ends.
            <br>
            In case you’re wondering, only a few people have ever managed to climb the peak of Mount Fitz Roy, and it’s
            very difficult and dangerous. The pointy peak has an elevation of 3,405 meters (11,171 feet).
            <br>
            Most of the Fitz Roy hike is not very difficult. I would rate it as moderate or even easy.
            <br>
            For example, you can get amazing views by hiking to the Fitz Roy viewpoint, which only takes about 1.5 hours
            (one way) from El Chalten. To this point, there’s a moderate elevation gain of about 330 meters (1,100
            feet). Most of the trail after that is flat and easy until you reach the final climb to Laguna De Los Tres.
            <br><br>
            If you go all the way to the lake (Laguna De Los Tres), then I’d rate the hike as hard. It’s still not
            dangerous, and you won’t be climbing with your hands, but it’s long and strenuous and the path gets pretty
            rough at the end, so it’s a challenge.
            <br>
            From El Chalten, the total one way distance is about 11 kilometers (7 miles) to Laguna De Los Tres, with
            plenty of elevation gain in the first and last two kilometers of the hike, but the rest of the trail is
            mostly flat and easy.
            <br><br>
            So in summary, Fitz Roy is a great day hike for all ages and abilities, and you don’t have to be very fit to
            see most of it, but the final climb to the lakes is tough, and non-hikers might have an issue with it.
            Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to
            society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or
            sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from
            village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support
            to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in
            sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of
            travelers both locally and internationally.[10]
            <br><br>
            In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men
            to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was
            known as the Grand Tour, and included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the
            French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.[8]
            <br><br>
            Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a
            network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started
            around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task.
            This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were
            booked together.[11] Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in
            the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and
            pilots.[8] Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited
            all 196 countries before the age of 21.[12]
